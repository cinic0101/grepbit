# Tier-0 contract

## QueryPlan (domain/plan.py)

```json
{
  "base_table": "pos_sale",
  "measures": [{"aggregate": "sum", "column": {"table": "pos_sale", "column": "total_amount"}},
               {"metric": "transaction_count"}],
  "dimensions": [{"table": "store", "column": "store_name"}],
  "filters": [{"column": {"table": "pos_sale", "column": "member_id"}, "op": "not_null"}],
  "time": {"column": {"table": "pos_sale", "column": "sale_date"},
           "scope": {"kind": "relative", "unit": "quarter", "offset": -1, "length": 1},
           "grain": "month"},
  "order": [{"field": "sum_total_amount", "direction": "desc"}],
  "limit": 5
}
```

- measures: 1 to 4; each is `aggregate` (sum, count, count_distinct, avg,
  min, max) over a column, `count` without a column, or `metric` (an overlay
  id). sum and avg need numeric columns; min and max need ordered kinds.
- dimensions: up to 3 columns of the base table or a table reachable by
  foreign keys away from the base (parent, grandparent, up to 3 hops).
- filters: up to 6; ops eq, ne, in, gt, gte, lt, lte, is_null, not_null;
  values typed against the column kind (numeric, boolean, text, timestamptz,
  date).
- time: one timestamp or date column; scope `month` (YYYY-MM), `range`
  (start, end_exclusive), `relative` (unit day, week, month, quarter, year;
  offset 0 is the current unit; length), or `periods` (2 to N months). Grain
  day, week, month, quarter, year is required when the scope has several
  periods.
- order fields are output names (dimension column, measure alias, or
  `period_start`); limit is 1 to 200.

## PlanProposal

`{"decision": "plan", "plan": {...}}` or `{"decision": "none", "reason":
"semantic_gap" | "unsupported" | "ambiguous", "clarification": "..."}`.

## PlanError codes (compile time, structural)

`unknown_table`, `unknown_column`, `grain_conflict` (a table not reachable by
foreign keys away from the base, including child tables and unrelated tables),
`ambiguous_join_path` (two foreign keys to the same parent, or two chains of
the same length), `aggregate_kind_mismatch`, `filter_kind_mismatch`,
`time_column_kind_mismatch`, `time_scope_requires_grain`, `unknown_metric`,
`metric_base_table_mismatch`, `metric_conflict`.

## Verification levels (CompiledPlan.verification)

| Level | When |
|---|---|
| `verified` | every measure is a verified reviewed metric and the plan adds no filters of its own |
| `partially_verified` | every measure is a reviewed metric but some are candidates, or the plan adds question filters that are checked for structure only |
| `unverified_semantics` | at least one raw aggregate: column meanings come from the schema alone |

## Response statuses (as the runner reports them; the served contract is in `../history/spec-v0.2-catalog-first.md` Section 8)

`answered`, `clarify`, `semantic_gap`, `unsupported`, `unsafe`, `failed`.

## Assumption sources

`reviewed` (from the overlay), `candidate` (inferred join, schema-only
meaning, question filters on a metric), `default` (server defaults: LEFT JOIN
keeps unmatched rows, NULLs ignored by aggregates, time window boundaries,
no filter applied).

## Prompt revisions

`PLAN_PROMPT_REVISION` in `adapters/litellm/plan_client.py` is `plan-classify-json-v5`.
History: v1 baseline; v2 prefer an entity's label column over its key; v3 a
business concept with no column, sample value or null check must decline;
v4 reviewed metrics rule (only when an overlay is present); v5 follow-up rule
(only when a previous turn is present) and week, quarter, year units.
